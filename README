===========
HyperWalker
===========

Hypertext organizer...

Current plan is to switch to using Netsurf as the viewer, and to refactor
so that the firefox/marionette logic is decoupled from the main logic, thus
generalizing the way HyperWalker gets documents.


Requirements
============

- firefox
- webkit2gtk-4.0 ( you probably need to install the development headers too )


Install
=======

.. code-block:: console

    $ go get -v -d git.callpipe.com/dvn/hyperwalker
    $ go get -v github.com/rakyll/statik
    $ cd $GOPATH/src/git.callpipe.com/dvn/hyperwalker
    $ go generate
    $ go build -o hyperwalker main.go
